          { "question": "What type of content works on TikTok?", "answer": "Authentic, native content performs best. Vertical videos of 15-60 seconds with a strong hook in the first 3 seconds, trend sounds and natural storytelling generate the best results. We avoid classic ads — on TikTok, content needs to feel organic." },
          { "question": "Are TikTok Ads right for my business?", "answer": "TikTok is ideal if your target audience is 18-45 years old. It works excellently for e-commerce, beauty, food, fitness, fashion and entertainment. However, even B2B brands find success on TikTok through educational content and creative thought leadership." },
          { "question": "What TikTok ad formats are available?", "answer": "The main formats are: In-Feed Ads (feed ads), TopView (full-screen on app open), Spark Ads (amplifying organic posts), Brand Effects (AR filters) and TikTok Shopping (integrated commerce). Each format has specific advantages depending on campaign objective." },
          { "question": "How long until I see results on TikTok?", "answer": "Initial results appear within the first 1-2 weeks. Full optimization takes 3-4 weeks as TikTok's algorithm learns and we identify the creative and audience combinations that perform best." },
          { "question": "TikTok Ads vs Instagram Reels — which is better?", "answer": "TikTok excels at organic reach and engagement with younger audiences (18-30), while Instagram Reels benefits from Meta's ecosystem and advanced targeting. We recommend a multi-platform strategy that includes both, alongside Google Ads campaigns for complete coverage." }

          { "question": "How much do SEO services cost?", "answer": "SEO service prices start from 500 EUR/month for basic packages that include on-page optimization and monitoring. Complete packages with technical audit, content strategy and link building start from 1,000 EUR/month. The exact cost depends on industry competitiveness, website size and your goals. Contact us for a free evaluation." },
          { "question": "How long does it take to see SEO results?", "answer": "SEO is a long-term investment. First ranking improvements are typically observed in 3-4 months, while significant results — consistent organic traffic growth and conversions — appear after 6-12 months of continuous optimization. This varies depending on keyword competitiveness and your website's current state." },
          { "question": "What does an SEO audit include?", "answer": "A complete SEO audit includes: technical analysis (speed, Core Web Vitals, indexing, mobile-friendliness), on-page audit (titles, meta, headings, content, internal links), off-page audit (backlink profile, domain authority), competition analysis and keyword research. We deliver a detailed report with prioritized issues and an action plan." },
          { "question": "What is the difference between On-Page and Off-Page SEO?", "answer": "On-Page SEO refers to optimizations made directly on your website: content, titles, meta descriptions, headings, images, internal links and URL structure. Off-Page SEO refers to actions outside your website that build authority: link building, guest posting, digital PR and mentions in relevant publications. Both are essential for ranking." },
          { "question": "Do you offer Local SEO?", "answer": "Yes, we offer complete Local SEO services. We optimize Google Business Profile, manage online reviews, build consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) citations in relevant directories and implement LocalBusiness schema markup. Local SEO is essential for businesses serving customers in a specific geographic area — combined with local Google Ads campaigns, we ensure complete visibility." },
          { "question": "How do you measure SEO results?", "answer": "We track clear metrics: target keyword rankings, organic traffic (Google Analytics + Search Console), click-through rate (CTR), conversions from organic traffic, Core Web Vitals and domain authority. Monthly reports include performance analysis, month-over-month comparisons and optimization recommendations. You also have access to a real-time dashboard." },
          { "question": "Why choose AceAgency for SEO?", "answer": "We combine technical SEO expertise with deep understanding of businesses in Romania.
