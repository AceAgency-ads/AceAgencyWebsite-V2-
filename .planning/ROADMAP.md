# Roadmap: AceAgency Website

## Overview

Build a premium corporate website for AceAgency (aceagency.ro) that serves as both a brand flagship and a lead-generation engine. The site must demonstrate design capability at addifico.com level — because for a digital agency, the website IS the portfolio. Animations and visual polish are the primary differentiator; every page phase uses `/frontend-design` against a spec generated by `/design`. Eight phases move from technical foundation through design-system generation, high-polish flagship pages, service pages, lead-capture functionality, legal compliance, SEO layer, and final launch readiness.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

Decimal phases appear between their surrounding integers in numeric order.

- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation** - Scaffold the project with all critical infrastructure wired correctly from day one
- [ ] **Phase 2: Design System** - Run `/design` skill (6-phase orchestrator) to generate complete visual language, then build shared layout components from the output
- [ ] **Phase 3: Flagship Pages** - Build Homepage and About to addifico.com visual quality with full animations — using `/frontend-design` against `design-system/pages/`
- [ ] **Phase 4: Service Pages** - Build Services index and all 6 individual service sub-pages using `/frontend-design` per page spec
- [ ] **Phase 5: Contact and Lead Capture** - Build Contact page with form, Cal.com booking, newsletter, and maps using `/frontend-design`
- [ ] **Phase 6: Compliance and Legal** - Build legal pages and wire GDPR cookie consent banner
- [ ] **Phase 7: SEO and Analytics** - Apply metadata, schema markup, hreflang, sitemap, analytics tracking
- [ ] **Phase 8: Polish and Launch** - Performance audit, accessibility verification, security headers, launch gate

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Foundation
**Goal**: The project runs locally and in CI with every critical infrastructure concern wired correctly — bilingual routing static, fonts loaded without CLS, GSAP centralized, brand tokens applied.
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: FNDN-01, FNDN-02, FNDN-03, FNDN-05, FNDN-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `npm run build` completes with zero errors and all `[locale]` pages show `○` (static) in build output — not `λ` (dynamic)
  2. Opening the site in a browser shows Glacial Indifference headings and Red Hat Display subheadings with zero layout shift (CLS = 0 on blank hero page)
  3. The locale switcher routes between `/ro/` and `/en/` and preserves the current page slug in both directions
  4. A test GSAP animation initialized via `useGSAP()` runs without console errors and cleans up on unmount
  5. Brand color tokens (Electric Violet, Cobalt Blue, Electric Mint, Black) are available as CSS custom properties and render correctly in a test component
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Next.js 16 scaffold with TypeScript strict, TailwindCSS 4, and shadcn/ui (new-york style)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — next-intl bilingual routing (RO/EN) with static rendering and LocaleSwitcher
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — Custom fonts, brand tokens, centralized GSAP, responsive Container

### Phase 2: Design System
**Goal**: The visual language is fully specified via the `/design` skill orchestrator, and shared layout components (Header, Footer, animation wrappers, custom cursor) are built from the generated specs — so every page phase can assemble sections without designing from scratch.

**The `/design` skill is a 6-phase orchestrator. Running it produces:**
1. **Context Gathering** — reads `.brief/` folder and brand guidelines
2. **Competitive Research** — visits competitor sites via Chrome MCP, writes analysis to `.design/research/`
3. **Design Direction** — presents 3 aesthetic directions; user selects one; chosen direction written to `.design/directions/`
4. **Design System Generation** — runs `/ui-ux-pro-max` + ReactBits component search; generates `design-system/MASTER.md` with page-specific overrides in `design-system/pages/*.md`
5. **Anti-AI Validation** — enforces distinctiveness rules (min 3/7 signals), writes `.design/validation-report.md`
6. **Output** — final artifacts: `design-system/MASTER.md`, `tokens.css`, `components.md`, `moodboard.md`, `design-system/pages/*.md`

The page specs in `design-system/pages/*.md` are the input consumed by `/frontend-design` in Phases 3–5.

**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: FNDN-04, DSGN-01, DSGN-05, DSGN-10, FUNC-04, FUNC-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `/design` skill has completed all 6 phases and produced `design-system/MASTER.md`, `tokens.css`, `components.md`, `moodboard.md`, and page specs in `design-system/pages/` — these files exist on disk
  2. The Header renders with the logo, navigation links, locale switcher (RO/EN), and a hamburger menu on mobile that opens/closes correctly
  3. The Header hides smoothly when scrolling down and reappears when scrolling up
  4. The Footer renders with social media links (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook) and site navigation
  5. A custom cursor effect appears on desktop (morphing or blend-mode) and is absent on touch devices
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 02-01: Run `/design` skill (full 6-phase) — gather context from `.brief/`, run competitive research, select design direction, generate design system and page specs, validate against anti-AI rules
- [ ] 02-02: Build Header (with locale switcher, sticky hide/show, mobile hamburger) and Footer (with social links) — implement against `design-system/MASTER.md` and `components.md`
- [ ] 02-03: Build shared animation wrappers (ScrollReveal, Parallax, TextReveal) as SSR-safe Client Components; build custom cursor component — referencing motion patterns defined in `design-system/MASTER.md`

### Phase 3: Flagship Pages
**Goal**: The Homepage and About page are complete with addifico.com-level visual quality — animations are the primary differentiator. Kinetic typography, scroll-triggered reveals, parallax depth, dark/light section transitions, bento grids, and hover micro-interactions prove design capability before any other pages are built.

**Each page is implemented using `/frontend-design`, which reads the page spec from `design-system/pages/{slug}.md` and generates production-quality components with animations wired in.**

**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: PAGE-01, PAGE-02, DSGN-02, DSGN-03, DSGN-04, DSGN-06, DSGN-07, DSGN-08, DSGN-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The homepage hero headline animates in with a staggered character or word reveal on load — visible on desktop and mobile — matching the kinetic typography pattern in `design-system/pages/home.md`
  2. Scrolling the homepage shows alternating dark and light section backgrounds that transition smoothly as sections enter the viewport
  3. The stats section shows animated number count-ups that trigger when the section scrolls into view
  4. The testimonials section displays in a bento-grid tile layout with at least 5 testimonials visible without a carousel
  5. All homepage sections have scroll-triggered reveal animations and card-level hover micro-interactions; mobile PageSpeed score is 85 or above
  6. The About page renders the agency story, values, and mission/vision with the same visual language and animation patterns as the homepage
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 03-01: Run `/frontend-design` on `design-system/pages/home.md` — implement Homepage Hero (kinetic typography, GSAP stagger) and Services Preview (bento grid with hover micro-interactions)
- [ ] 03-02: Implement Homepage Stats (scroll-triggered count-up via GSAP ScrollTrigger), Testimonials (bento tile layout), CTA, and Newsletter sections — all scroll-reveal animated
- [ ] 03-03: Run `/frontend-design` on `design-system/pages/despre-noi.md` — implement About page (agency story, values, mission/vision) with matching animation patterns; bilingual content for both pages in `ro.json` + `en.json`

### Phase 4: Service Pages
**Goal**: All 7 service pages (index + 6 sub-pages) are live with structured content, service-specific CTAs, FAQ sections, and animations consistent with Phases 2–3 — these are the primary SEO surface for organic traffic.

**Each page is implemented using `/frontend-design` against `design-system/pages/{slug}.md`. Service pages inherit the animation system from Phase 3 but use structured, SEO-optimized content layouts.**

**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: PAGE-03, PAGE-04, PAGE-05, PAGE-06, PAGE-07, PAGE-08, PAGE-09
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. The Services index page links to all 6 service sub-pages and each link resolves to a functional page in both RO and EN
  2. Each service sub-page has a distinct hero, a benefits/features section, a process section, a FAQ accordion, and a CTA — using the visual and animation patterns established in Phase 3 and specified in `design-system/pages/servicii-{slug}.md`
  3. All FAQ accordions on service pages expand and collapse correctly with keyboard navigation
  4. Bilingual content exists for every service page in `ro.json` and `en.json` with no missing translation keys
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01: Run `/frontend-design` on `design-system/pages/servicii.md` — implement Services index page; build ServiceHero, ServiceFeatures, ServiceFaq, ServiceCta section components reusable across all 6 sub-pages
- [ ] 04-02: Run `/frontend-design` for Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads service pages — implement with full bilingual content and shared section components
- [ ] 04-03: Run `/frontend-design` for SEO, Email Marketing, Consultanta Marketing service pages — implement with full bilingual content

### Phase 5: Contact and Lead Capture
**Goal**: Visitors can contact AceAgency, book a meeting, and subscribe to the newsletter — all lead-capture mechanisms are functional, validated, and deliverable via Resend.

**The Contact page is implemented using `/frontend-design` against `design-system/pages/contact.md`.**

**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: PAGE-10, FUNC-01, FUNC-02, FUNC-03, FUNC-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Submitting the contact form with valid data sends an email via Resend and shows a success confirmation to the user
  2. Submitting the contact form with invalid data shows field-level validation errors without a page reload
  3. The Cal.com booking widget renders on the contact page and allows selecting a meeting slot without navigating away
  4. The Google Maps embed shows the AceAgency office location on the contact page
  5. Submitting the newsletter form with a valid email shows a success state; the email is captured via Resend
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 05-01: Run `/frontend-design` on `design-system/pages/contact.md` — implement Contact page layout (ContactInfo, Google Maps embed); build Server Actions (`lib/actions/contact.ts`) with Zod validation, honeypot, and Resend delivery
- [ ] 05-02: Cal.com booking embed (try `@calcom/embed-react`; fall back to inline script) and Newsletter Server Action (`lib/actions/newsletter.ts`)

### Phase 6: Compliance and Legal
**Goal**: The site meets Romanian/EU legal requirements — granular cookie consent banner, legal pages in both languages, and analytics gated behind consent — making the site legally launchable.
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: PAGE-11, PAGE-12, PAGE-13, PAGE-14, CMPL-01, CMPL-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. On first visit, a cookie consent banner appears with granular toggles for analytics, marketing, and functional cookies — the user's choice persists across sessions
  2. When cookie consent has not been granted, no GA4 or GTM events fire (verifiable via browser network tab and GTM preview mode)
  3. The Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Terms of Service pages render complete bilingual content in both `/ro/` and `/en/` locales
  4. The FAQ page at `/intrebari-frecvente` renders with accordion-style questions and answers in both languages
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 06-01: GDPR cookie consent banner (shadcn-cookie-consent) with granular consent state and GTM Consent Mode v2 gating
- [ ] 06-02: Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Terms of Service pages with full bilingual content
- [ ] 06-03: FAQ page (`/intrebari-frecvente`) with bilingual content and FAQPage schema scaffold

### Phase 7: SEO and Analytics
**Goal**: Every page has complete metadata, JSON-LD schema, hreflang, Open Graph tags, and analytics tracking — the site is fully indexed and measured from day one.
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: SEO-01, SEO-02, SEO-03, SEO-04, SEO-05, SEO-07, SEO-08, CMPL-03, CMPL-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` are present and correct on every page (verifiable via `curl` or DevTools); title is under 60 characters, description under 155
  2. Every page has `<link rel="canonical">` and `<link rel="alternate" hreflang>` tags for both `ro` and `en` plus `x-default`
  3. JSON-LD schema blocks (Organization, LocalBusiness on homepage; Service on service pages; FAQ where applicable; BreadcrumbList on inner pages) are present in page source and validate without errors in Google's Rich Results Test
  4. `sitemap.xml` returns HTTP 200 and lists all pages; `robots.txt` returns HTTP 200 and does not block Googlebot
  5. Vercel Analytics is tracking pageviews; GA4 fires a `page_view` event after cookie consent is granted (verifiable in GA4 DebugView)
  6. GA4 `generate_lead` event fires when the contact form submits successfully
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 07-01: `lib/seo/metadata.ts` factory (generateMetadata with hreflang, Open Graph, Twitter Card, canonical) applied to all pages
- [ ] 07-02: `lib/seo/schemas.ts` JSON-LD builders (Organization, LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, BreadcrumbList) injected into all pages
- [ ] 07-03: `app/sitemap.ts`, `app/robots.ts`, Vercel Analytics integration, GA4 + GTM via `next/script`, and `generate_lead` event tracking on contact form

### Phase 8: Polish and Launch
**Goal**: The site is verified against every launch-blocking criterion — mobile PageSpeed 90+, WCAG 2.1 AA, security headers, reduced motion support, bilingual content completeness — and is ready to go live at aceagency.ro.
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: SEO-06, CMPL-04, CMPL-05, CMPL-06, CMPL-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. PageSpeed Insights reports 90 or above on mobile for the homepage, at least one service page, and the contact page
  2. All pages pass WCAG 2.1 AA automated checks (axe DevTools or equivalent) — no critical or serious violations
  3. Every key in `ro.json` has a corresponding key in `en.json` with non-placeholder content
  4. The custom 404 page renders with navigation back to the site when visiting a non-existent URL
  5. Security headers (HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`) are present on all responses (verifiable via SecurityHeaders.com)
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 08-01: Performance audit (PageSpeed Insights on mobile, 6x CPU throttle, GSAP memory leak heap snapshot after 10 navigations), fix regressions
- [ ] 08-02: WCAG 2.1 AA audit (axe DevTools), reduced motion support verification, bilingual content completeness check
- [ ] 08-03: Security headers in `next.config.ts`, HTTPS/301 redirect verification, custom 404 page, CMPL-06 redirect rules; final pre-launch checklist
